Our Vision 
At The European, our commitment to excellence, quality, and accessibility drives us to create 
a space where exceptional food is both high-quality and available to all. We prioritize using 
the finest ingredients, sourced locally whenever possible, honoring both time-honored 
traditions and modern techniques to ensure outstanding taste and freshness. 
We take pride in serving our guests milk from grass-fed cows and eggs from free-range 
chickens. While we champion local ingredients, we also recognize the unmatched quality of 
certain European products. That's why we import our chocolate and many of our pastry 
ingredients directly from Europe, ensuring the authenticity of our creations. 
Our goal is to provide a streamlined, quick-service experience that allows our guests to enjoy 
quality food without sacrificing time. The European embodies the identity of a modern 
European café—deeply rooted in cultural heritage and old-world values while embracing 
forward-thinking, adaptable progress. We cherish quality and craftsmanship, whether in food 
or everyday life, and balance this with the demands of a fast-paced world. This is why The 
European stands for both excellence and efficiency. 
 
Our Mission 
At The European, we are dedicated to crafting exceptional food that celebrates the artistry of 
European baking, scratch cooking, and the richness of local farms. Our mission is to create a 
vibrant, welcoming space where every dish—whether a delicate pastry or a hearty breakfast—
is made from scratch with the finest ingredients and a commitment to excellence. 
We believe that food is more than just sustenance; it is a celebration of flavors, a connection 
to the earth, a way to embrace different cultures, and a source of health and nourishment.

The European's Equal Employment Opportunity Policy 
 
The European is an Equal Opportunity Employer that does not discriminate on the basis of 
actual or perceived race, creed, color, religion, alienage or national origin, ancestry, 
citizenship status, age, disability or handicap, sex (including pregnancy, gender identity, and 
sexual orientation), marital status, veteran status, genetic information, arrest record, or any 
other characteristic protected by applicable federal, state, or local laws. Our management 
team is dedicated to this policy with respect to recruitment, hiring, placement, promotion, 
transfer, training, compensation, benefits, employee activities, and general treatment 
during employment. 

Accommodations for Individuals with Disabilities: The European will make reasonable 
accommodations, as required by law, for known physical or mental disabilities of an otherwise 
qualified applicant or employee, unless doing so would impose an undue hardship on the 
company's operations. An accommodation is not reasonable if the employee cannot perform 
essential job duties safely or effectively even with the accommodation. Employees needing 
accommodations must contact the company recruiter and provide supporting medical 
documentation. The European will engage in an interactive process to determine if an 
accommodation can be made and will notify the employee within a reasonable period. All medical 
information submitted will be treated confidentially. 
Religious Accommodations: The European will also attempt to reasonably accommodate the 
sincere religious beliefs of its employees, provided it does not create an undue hardship on 
business operations. 

Employees with questions or concerns about equal employment opportunities are encouraged to 
bring these issues to their Direct Supervisor or their HR Manager. The European prohibits retaliation 
against individuals who raise equal employment opportunity issues. Employees who believe they 
have been subjected to retaliation should contact their Direct Supervisor or HR Manager 
immediately. Violations of this policy, including any retaliatory conduct, will lead to discipline, up to 
and including termination. All employees are expected to cooperate fully with any investigations.

another person based on any protected classification, including but not limited to race, color, 
national origin, disability, religion, marital status, veteran status, sex (including pregnancy, gender 
identity, and sexual orientation), or age. This policy aims to ensure a harassment-free workplace 
and applies to all employees. 

If an employee feels they have been subjected to conduct that violates this policy, they should 
immediately report the matter to their Direct Supervisor. If the employee has not received a 
satisfactory response within five (5) business days after reporting the incident, the employee 
should contact their Manager. If the person towards whom the complaint is directed is one of these 
individuals, the employee should escalate to a higher-level manager. Every report of perceived 
harassment will be fully investigated, and corrective action will be taken where appropriate. 
All complaints will be kept confidential to the extent possible, but confidentiality cannot be 
guaranteed. The European will not allow any form of retaliation against individuals who report 
unwelcome conduct or cooperate in investigations. Employees who believe they have been 
retaliated against should report it following the same procedure. Violation of this policy will result in 
disciplinary action, up to and including discharge.

and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature. Examples include inappropriate jokes, 
comments about a person’s appearance, or sexual teasing.

matter immediately to their Direct Supervisor. If unable to contact this person or if no satisfactory 
response is received within five (5) business days, the employee should escalate to their Manager.

compensated correctly. 

Time Worked: Time worked includes all hours a non-exempt employee performs work on behalf of 
the company. All time must be recorded in the company's designated timekeeping system. 
Employees must not work "off-the-clock," and any unauthorized work will result in disciplinary 
action. 

Timekeeping: Employees are responsible for accurately recording the time they start and end their 
work each day, including meal breaks, overtime, and split shifts. All time records must be verified 
by employees and all change and/or correction requests must be submitted for approval before 
payroll processing.

The European's Meal & Rest Break Policy 
 
Purpose: The European recognizes the necessity of providing employees with designated meal and 
rest breaks to maintain productivity and well-being. This policy ensures compliance with relevant 
labor laws and defines company expectations concerning meal and rest breaks.
 
Rest Periods: All employees are permitted a ten (10)-minute paid rest break for each four (4)-hour 
work period. Breaks are not permitted at either the beginning or end of the workday to offset arrival 
and departure times. Employees who voluntarily work through their rest breaks will not be paid 
additional compensation as the company already considers this time to be compensated. 

Meal Periods: All employees who work eight (8) or more hours in a day may take an unpaid meal 
break of thirty (30) minutes, which should be taken towards the middle of their shift. Meal breaks 
are not counted toward hours worked as it is the Company’s goal to completely relieve employees 
from all duties during their meal break. If a non-exempt employee performs any work duties while 
on their unpaid meal break period, the employee must record this time on their time record and the 
Company will consider this as time worked

hours in advance, such as for vacation, bereavement, or jury duty. Employees are allowed up to 10 
days for part-time employees and 15 days for full-time employees of excused absences per year. 
Unplanned Absences: Unplanned absences are for unexpected events such as illness or 
emergencies. Employees must notify their supervisor at least one hour before their scheduled shift. 
Employees are allowed up to 10 days of unplanned absence per year. A doctor’s note will be 
required for medical absences. 

Unexcused Absences: Unexcused absences occur when an employee fails to notify management 
of their absence or exceeds their allowed unplanned absences. No more than three unexcused 
absences are allowed within a 12-month period. Failure to adhere to this policy may result in 
termination. 

Shift Coverage: If unable to attend a scheduled shift, employees are responsible for arranging 
coverage. If unable to find coverage, they must notify management immediately. Failure to secure 
coverage will result in the absence being classified as unexcused unless it was approved by a 
management. 

Tardiness: Employees are expected to report to work on time. Employees are permitted up to five 
instances of tardiness per year. Excessive tardiness will lead to disciplinary action, up to and 
including termination.

The European's Early Departures Policy 

Purpose

disrupt operations, cause undue pressure on other staff members, and compromise the company's 
ability to meet customer expectations. 

Policy

their replacement arrives to relieve them of their duties. Failure to obtain such authorization or 
secure a replacement is considered a violation of this policy and will be subject to immediate 
corrective action. 

Enforcement 
Leaving work without proper authorization may result in disciplinary measures, up to and including 
termination of employment. Repeated violations will be treated as a performance issue, and the 
company reserves the right to take immediate action, including dismissal, depending on the 
severity and impact of the violation.

dress and appearance. Employees who do not meet the dress code standards outlined in this 
policy may be sent home to change. Non-exempt employees will not be compensated for any 
work time missed due to failure to comply with this policy. Reasonable accommodations will 
be considered for religious or medical exemptions.

The European's Tip Pooling Policy 

Purpose 
The European’s Tip Pooling Policy ensures that all eligible employees, including both front-of-
house and back-of-house staff, receive an equitable share of tips earned during each pay 
period. This policy is compliant with the Department of Labor’s guidelines under the Fair 
Labor Standards Act (FLSA), allowing non-tipped employees to participate in tip pools, 
provided all employees receive at least the full minimum wage. 

Eligibility 
All non-management, non-supervisory employees who customarily and regularly receive tips, 
along with back-of-house staff (such as cooks, bakers, and dishwashers), are eligible to 
participate in the tip pool.  

Exclusion of Management and Supervisors 
Managers, supervisors, and salaried employees are strictly prohibited from participating in 
the tip pool. Under no circumstances will individuals with management or supervisory 
responsibilities receive any portion of the pooled tips, even if they occasionally perform non-
managerial duties. 

Distribution of Tips 
1. Even Distribution: All tips collected during each pay period will be pooled and evenly 
distributed among eligible front- and back-of-house employees, including bakers and 
kitchen staff (for example). Distribution will be based on the number of hours worked 
or another equitable method determined by management. 

2. Transparency: Tip distribution will be transparent, with all eligible employees receiving 
a detailed breakdown of their share of the pooled tips. The company will use a 
standardized method to calculate and distribute tips, ensuring consistency and 
fairness. 

3. Reporting Tips: All tips distributed through the pool must be reported for payroll and 
tax purposes. Employees are required to declare their tips accurately as part of their 
total earnings, and The European will ensure compliance with all reporting obligations 
under federal and state law.
 
Legal Compliance 
This policy is designed to comply with federal and state regulations, including the Fair Labor 
Standards Act (FLSA). Bakers, kitchen staff, and other back-of-house employees are eligible 
for tip pooling only if all employees receive at least the full minimum wage (not the tipped 
minimum wage). Any changes to these laws will result in an immediate review and update of 
this policy to ensure compliance. 

Enforcement 
Failure to comply with this policy, including the failure to report tips or any attempt to 
circumvent the policy, will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of 
employment. Management reserves the right to audit the tip pooling process regularly to 
ensure full compliance.

performance issues. The company reserves the right to bypass steps in the disciplinary process, 
depending on the severity of the violation. 

Process 
1. Verbal Warning: For minor infractions, a verbal warning may be issued. 
2. Written Warning: A more serious infraction or repeated violations will result in a written 
warning. 

3. Final Warning: If performance does not improve after the written warning, a final warning

4. Termination: Continued violations, or severe misconduct, may result in termination without 
further warnings.
