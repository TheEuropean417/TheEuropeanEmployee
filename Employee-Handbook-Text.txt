Our Vision 
At The European, our commitment to excellence, quality, and accessibility drives us to create 
a space where exceptional food is both high-quality and available to all. We prioritize using 
the finest ingredients, sourced locally whenever possible, honoring both time-honored 
traditions and modern techniques to ensure outstanding taste and freshness. 
We take pride in serving our guests milk from grass-fed cows and eggs from free-range 
chickens. While we champion local ingredients, we also recognize the unmatched quality of 
certain European products. That's why we import our chocolate and many of our pastry 
ingredients directly from Europe, ensuring the authenticity of our creations. 
Our goal is to provide a streamlined, quick-service experience that allows our guests to enjoy 
quality food without sacrificing time. The European embodies the identity of a modern 
European café—deeply rooted in cultural heritage and old-world values while embracing 
forward-thinking, adaptable progress. We cherish quality and craftsmanship, whether in food 
or everyday life, and balance this with the demands of a fast-paced world. This is why The 
European stands for both excellence and efficiency. 
 
Our Mission 
At The European, we are dedicated to crafting exceptional food that celebrates the artistry of 
European baking, scratch cooking, and the richness of local farms. Our mission is to create a 
vibrant, welcoming space where every dish—whether a delicate pastry or a hearty breakfast—
is made from scratch with the finest ingredients and a commitment to excellence. 
We believe that food is more than just sustenance; it is a celebration of flavors, a connection 
to the earth, a way to embrace different cultures, and a source of health and nourishment.

The European's Equal Employment Opportunity Policy 
 
The European is an Equal Opportunity Employer that does not discriminate on the basis of 
actual or perceived race, creed, color, religion, alienage or national origin, ancestry, 
citizenship status, age, disability or handicap, sex (including pregnancy, gender identity, and 
sexual orientation), marital status, veteran status, genetic information, arrest record, or any 
other characteristic protected by applicable federal, state, or local laws. Our management 
team is dedicated to this policy with respect to recruitment, hiring, placement, promotion, 
transfer, training, compensation, benefits, employee activities, and general treatment 
during employment. 

Accommodations for Individuals with Disabilities: The European will make reasonable 
accommodations, as required by law, for known physical or mental disabilities of an otherwise 
qualified applicant or employee, unless doing so would impose an undue hardship on the 
company's operations. An accommodation is not reasonable if the employee cannot perform 
essential job duties safely or effectively even with the accommodation. Employees needing 
accommodations must contact the company recruiter and provide supporting medical 
documentation. The European will engage in an interactive process to determine if an 
accommodation can be made and will notify the employee within a reasonable period. All medical 
information submitted will be treated confidentially. 
Religious Accommodations: The European will also attempt to reasonably accommodate the 
sincere religious beliefs of its employees, provided it does not create an undue hardship on 
business operations. 

Employees with questions or concerns about equal employment opportunities are encouraged to 
bring these issues to their Direct Supervisor or their HR Manager. The European prohibits retaliation 
against individuals who raise equal employment opportunity issues. Employees who believe they 
have been subjected to retaliation should contact their Direct Supervisor or HR Manager 
immediately. Violations of this policy, including any retaliatory conduct, will lead to discipline, up to 
and including termination. All employees are expected to cooperate fully with any investigations.

The European's Non-Harassment Policy 
It is The European’s policy to prohibit intentional and unintentional harassment of any individual by 
another person based on any protected classification, including but not limited to race, color, 
national origin, disability, religion, marital status, veteran status, sex (including pregnancy, gender 
identity, and sexual orientation), or age. This policy aims to ensure a harassment-free workplace 
and applies to all employees. 

If an employee feels they have been subjected to conduct that violates this policy, they should 
immediately report the matter to their Direct Supervisor. If the employee has not received a 
satisfactory response within five (5) business days after reporting the incident, the employee 
should contact their Manager. If the person towards whom the complaint is directed is one of these 
individuals, the employee should escalate to a higher-level manager. Every report of perceived 
harassment will be fully investigated, and corrective action will be taken where appropriate. 
All complaints will be kept confidential to the extent possible, but confidentiality cannot be 
guaranteed. The European will not allow any form of retaliation against individuals who report 
unwelcome conduct or cooperate in investigations. Employees who believe they have been 
retaliated against should report it following the same procedure. Violation of this policy will result in 
disciplinary action, up to and including discharge.
